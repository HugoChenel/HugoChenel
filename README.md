### About Me

🔬 **Research Engineer - Evotec**  
📚 **PhD Student (CIFRE thesis)**

👋 Hi there! I'm a passionate researcher and engineer with a focus on cancer research and network theory. Currently, I'm working as a Research Engineer at **Evotec**, where I have the exciting opportunity to bridge the gap between academia and industry. I'm also a dedicated PhD student, conducting my research at the **Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT)**. My PhD journey is funded by **Evotec**, which allows me to explore innovative avenues in cancer research and drug discovery.

### Research Focus

🔍 My research revolves around the development and validation of a cutting-edge prototype: a **Digital Twin platform** designed for **virtual clinical trials** and **in silico drug screenings**. This platform leverages the power of **deep multiomics tumor profiling** to create realistic computational models.

Specifically, my thesis project involves:

🧬 **Integrating multi-omics data**: Bringing together diverse biological data sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of cancer.

🔗 **Infer multilayer networks**: Using advanced network inferring tools and analysis techniques to uncover intricate relationships within the data.

💊 **Virtual compound screening**: Applying these insights to perform virtual screenings of potential drug candidates on in-silico, molecularly, and clinically realistic cohorts.

My aim is to contribute to the advancement of cancer research by developing innovative tools and methodologies that can accelerate drug discovery and improve patient outcomes.
